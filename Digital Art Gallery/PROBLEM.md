# Digital Art Gallery

Implement a digital art gallery management system in C++ that models `Artwork`, `Gallery`, and `Exhibition` classes. Each artwork has a title, artist, ID, medium, and price, and can be marked as sold. The gallery stores artworks using move semantics to avoid unnecessary copies, while the exhibition curates a selection of featured pieces. Practice copy constructors, move constructors, and null-pointer safety when dynamically adding artworks to an active exhibition display.
