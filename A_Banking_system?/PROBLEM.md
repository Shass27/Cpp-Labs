# Banking System

Design a simple banking system in C++ that supports multiple bank accounts identified by unique IDs. Each account should allow deposits and withdrawals through a nested `Transaction` class. The system must also support transferring money between two accounts, gracefully handling edge cases such as account not found or insufficient funds. Use object-oriented principles including encapsulation and clear class relationships to model the `Bank`, `BankAccount`, and `Transaction` entities.
